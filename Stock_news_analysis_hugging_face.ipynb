              "\"There’s a tug of war between Tesla (TSLA) bulls and bears on Wall Street. Tesla reported an earnings beat for Q3, but a revenue miss, reflecting a concern among some that demand might be coming down a bit for its premium electric vehicles. Tesla bulls contend that CEO Elon Musk said challenges to physical delivery of vehicles to customers was a main bottleneck — and why the number of cars produced in Q3 was significantly higher than deliveries. “In fact, we're just fundamentally running out of — there weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains, there weren't enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big,” Musk said on the earnings call. “So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren't just enough transportation objects to move them around.” At the same time, Musk warned about demand issues stemming from China’s property market headwinds, Europe in the midst of an energy-driven recession, and the effects of the Fed’s tightening cycle on the U.S. economy. “There is a bit of doublespeak,” George Gianarikas, Canaccord Genuity managing director, told Yahoo Finance. “Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue, particularly in China … but at the same time he said the company would grow significantly in Q4.” “There’s method to the madness and there’s logic as to why [Musk] guided them to grow so significantly this year and continue growth into next year, but I completely agree and understand that there are too many breadcrumbs that indicate that there has been a slowdown in demand, and he even acknowledged it on yesterday’s call,” Gianarikas said. On the positive site, Gianarikas believes the backlog of orders, demand for new EVs in general, fleet sales, and the coming production of the Cybertruck in 2023, and more Tesla Semi sales will boost Tesla in the near future, despite some economic uncertainty. “We think they could do about 450,000 deliveries [in Q4]; they’re going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future which is about 50% year over year growth as fast as the eye can see,” Gianarikas said about the Canaccord team’s forecast for Tesla’s performance. Another area of future development for Tesla that has Gianarikas excited for growth is the “next-generation” vehicle as Musk called, which would be smaller in size, and\""

Doing the math, that would put Tesla\\'s worth at about $4 trillion at some point. Tesla\\'s current market cap is $652 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data. Analysts say that valuation may not happen for eons, if at all. \"That seems quite a bit of a stretch,\" Colin Langan, equity analyst at Wells Fargo, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \"You would have to give them full credit for all of these factors that I consider more long-term optionality issues. So things like whether you can get true level four self-driving, whether there is some value in the Optimus bot, Dojo, and these future projects. I think from a pure automaker side, that [valuation] is going to be extremely difficult to do.\" Tesla\\'s path toward Musk\\'s newest goalpost was off to a rocky start on Thursday. Tesla stock fell more than 6% as of 1:40 p.m. ET as the EV maker warned that it would not meet its 50% growth target for deliveries this year. Tesla\\'s total revenue for the third quarter also fell short of analyst estimates. Wall Street also speculated that a slowdown in Tesla sales in China may be coming soon, which could put further pressure on the stock. \"Tesla continued to attribute the 3Q delivery miss to ending the historical delivery wave to help reduce logistics costs, but we believe weaker demand in China is the most likely explanation,\" Guggenheim analyst Ali Faghri wrote in a note to clients. \"We highlight the following: 1) final week deliveries in China were likely down 30%+ vs. 2Q levels (could be ending the delivery wave, could be weaker demand); 2) Tesla placed a modest incentive on China vehicles in September to push sales towards the end of the quarter; 3) wait times in China compressed from 20+ weeks to 1-4 weeks at the end of 3Q;',\n",
              "  '(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk sees Tesla Inc. becoming bigger than the combined valuation of Apple Inc. and Saudi Aramco one day. Wall Street is saying, not so fast.

This is the first time the company missed revenue estimates since the third quarter of 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Chief Executive Officer Musk also said demand was a “little harder than it would otherwise be,” due to downturns in China and Europe. The results and the cautious stance on demand prompted multiple analysts to lower their price target on the company on Thursday. The average price target on the company stands at $293, according to Bloomberg data, over 40% higher than the stock’s Thursday close. Tesla shares closed down 6.7% at $207.28. “We remain cautious on valuation, particularly in the context of lofty unit volume growth expectations, and continue to see material downside risk to our December 2023 price target,” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note. Tesla, which was briefly a part of the trillion-dollar valuation group, currently has a market capitalization of about $650 billion. Apple has a $2.3 trillion value, while Saudi Aramco’s stands at roughly $2.1 trillion. As the US consumer gets squeezed between high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates, investors are keeping an eye on demand for discretionary items and big-ticket purchases like a car this earnings season. After Tesla earlier this month reported third-quarter deliveries below expectations, analysts and investors have been watching for any signs of cracks in demand. Risks to demand is an especially fraught concern for Tesla because of its rich valuation that is heavily dependent on the company’s future growth potential. Tesla’s stock trades',\n",

Most Read from Bloomberg Rolex Prices to Drop Further as Supply Surges: Morgan Stanley NATO-China Tension Over Ukraine Flares at Conference in Iceland Diesel Hits Chaos Mode in Fresh Blow for Global Economy The electric vehicle-maker’s shares closed down 7.6% to $204.99 on Friday, taking its market capitalization to $642 billion. The decline has now sliced in half the stock’s Nov. 4 record closing high of $409.97. The plunge comes amid a wider meltdown in the markets, as the specter of an economic slowdown rattles investors already bracing for the impact of rising inflation and higher interest rates. Riskier growth stocks with rich valuations have borne the brunt of the selloff. Tesla’s own list of woes are long: Vehicle delivery in the third quarter took a hit due to logistical troubles, and some analysts warned that the climbing prices of the company’s cars may also weigh on demand at some point. On top of that, Tesla’s factory in Shanghai has faced disruptions due to Covid-19 lockdowns in the city. The company has also dealt with supply shortages and a surge in raw material costs, as has almost every other automaker around the globe. Chief Executive Elon Musk’s highly public attempt to first buy Twitter Inc., then to walk away from the deal and buy it again, has also been a drag on the stock, due to concerns that the company’s leader is spreading himself too thin between several challenging ventures.

Here are the most important numbers from the report. Q3 Revenue: $21.45 billion versus $22.09 billion expected Q3 Adjusted EPS: $1.05 versus $1.01 expected Shares of the automaker fell more than 5% following the announcement. The company says it still expects to see 50% average annual growth rate on vehicle deliveries for the year. The automaker also said it believes it has enough liquidity to continue to build out its roadmap. Still, Tesla says that it's facing year-over-year headwinds from the increased cost of raw materials and inefficiencies at its Gigafactory Berlin. A strengthening dollar is also impacting Tesla sales abroad, cutting into profitability. Prior to its earnings report, Tesla announced that it produced 365,932 vehicles in the quarter and delivered 343,830. That's up from the 258,580 it produced and 254,695 it delivered in Q2, when the company was beset by COVID-related shutdowns in China. In Q3 2021, the company produced 237,823 vehicles and delivered 241,300. As for the company's future products, Tesla says it expects to roll out its semi to Pepsi in December, and that it will begin producing its Cybertruck in Texas after ramping its Model Y production.

Tesla reported an earnings beat for Q3, but a revenue miss, reflecting a concern among some that demand might be coming down a bit for its premium electric vehicles. Tesla bulls contend that CEO Elon Musk said challenges to physical delivery of vehicles to customers was a main bottleneck — and why the number of cars produced in Q3 was significantly higher than deliveries. “In fact, we're just fundamentally running out of — there weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains, there weren't enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big,” Musk said on the earnings call. “So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren't just enough transportation objects to move them around.” At the same time, Musk warned about demand issues stemming from China’s property market headwinds, Europe in the midst of an energy-driven recession, and the effects of the Fed’s tightening cycle on the U.S. economy. “There is a bit of doublespeak,” George Gianarikas, Canaccord Genuity managing director, told Yahoo Finance. “Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue, particularly in China … but at the same time he said the company would grow significantly in Q4.” “There’s method to the madness and there’s logic as to why [Musk] guided them to grow so significantly this year and continue growth into next year, but I completely agree and understand that there are too many breadcrumbs that indicate that there has been a slowdown in demand, and he even acknowledged it on yesterday’s call,” Gianarikas said. On the positive site, Gianarikas believes the backlog of orders, demand for new EVs in general, fleet sales, and the coming production of the Cybertruck in 2023, and more Tesla Semi sales will boost Tesla in the near future, despite some economic uncertainty. “We think they could do about 450,000 deliveries [in Q4]; they’re going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future which is\",\n",
              "  'OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Wednesday said he was excited about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc, although he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, was answering a question during a call after the electric vehicle maker\\'s quarterly report. The world\\'s richest person is pursuing the Twitter purchase after earlier trying to back out of the $44 billion deal. Musk described Twitter as an asset that had \"languished\" for a long time. \"Myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now. The long term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,\" he said. In the same conference call Musk also spoke optimistically about Tesla. Tesla, with a market cap now under $700 billion, could be worth more than the combined value of Apple Inc\\'s $2.3 trillion and oil producer Saudi Aramco\\'s $2.1 trillion, he said. Musk has been trying to raise cash to fund the Twitter purchase, and some experts say he may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after the Tesla quarterly report to do so. A Delaware judge ordered a pause to Twitter Inc\\'s lawsuit against Elon Musk, giving the billionaire until Oct. 28 to close the deal. Tesla investors feared that the billionaire may sell more Tesla stocks to finance the deal and may be spreading himself too thin, pulling down shares. Musk, CEO of SpaceX, and Neuralink and Boring Company, said on Wednesday that he does not have a current plan to combine them with Twitter under one umbrella.

Well, with both GameStop and AMC mired in the throes of a full-fledged bear market, barring the occasional short-squeeze such as the one that occurred this summer, investors have adopted a largely hands-off approach to the meme stock universe, with many patiently waiting for a more conducive macroeconomic environment to add to their bullish bets. Of course, the SEC and even Congress have been visibly discomfited by the evolving stock mania, with the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services calling on the SEC back in June to do more to “protect the markets” from similar events, taking cognizance of the “big losses” that some hedge funds suffered as a result of the periodic short squeeze in GameStop and AMC shares, which invariably then turns into a short-lived but intense gamma squeeze. However, while the SEC has only chosen to take cosmetic steps to tackle the underlying perception of “rigged markets” that fuels the mania in GameStop, AMC, and other meme stocks, it has diverted a significant portion of its resources to actively warn investors against betting on these high-beta plays. After all, who can forget the cringe-worthy 30-second video that the SEC published on meme stocks back in June 2022?  This brings us to the crux of the matter. The SEC recently responded to a request by the Twitter user @etanleibovitz18 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Apparently, the regulator spent nearly $100,000 in producing the 30-second video that was meant to deter investors from betting on meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC.

Its Fundamental Value fund, with a long-term short bias, outperformed the market in Q2, returning -1.4% versus -16.1% for the S&P 500. The hedge fund provided detailed insights regarding its short positions at the end of August. According to Bireme Capital, in the first half of 2022, many investors failed to learn the many lessons of the bull market of the last decade and came to believe that \"stocks only go up.\" They noted that \"sexy stories&apos&apos had become more important than profitability.

Class A Report, and MicroStrategy\\xa0 (MSTR) - Get MicroStrategy Incorporated Report\\xa0among them - are still trading at irrational prices. Their fund&aposs short book is full of these retail-favorite names. However, in its report, the fund points out that, \"amazingly,\" GameStop is one of the only short positions that has not yet fallen in 2022. The fact that the video game retailer is trading at a market cap far above its pre-pandemic peak, despite its revenues being 30% below their peak, has left the fund managers perplexed. Bireme Capital points out that GameStop has also generated negative free cash flow of $700 million over the last four quarters. Wall Street estimates have been downwardly revised in 2022, reinforcing the bear thesis. Finally, the hedge fund sees GameStop as an example of a meme stock company making its way into a new business model by using the popularity of its stock to drive new business paths.

The $24 area has been tested eight times since Sept. 7, with the bears unable to break the stock down lower. Meanwhile, GameStop’s relative strength index (RSI) has been slowly rising, which has caused exaggerated bullish divergence to develop. An exaggerated bullish divergence occurs when a stock makes a series of equal bottoms over a specific timeframe, while the relative strength index (RSI) oscillator makes a series of higher lows. Bullish divergence suggests that the bulls are regaining control and can mark an eventual break up from a sideways trading pattern. Divergences are best used when combined with other signals and patterns on a stock’s chart because the existence of divergence doesn’t indicate when a possible reversal will occur.

Some of my favorites include a shower beer can holder, squish balls, Pampers diapers, toddler walkers, and a vent clip that holds chicken nugget dipping sauce. Diapers and stress balls are a little odd, but normal people do use them. On the other hand, I want to know if there are really freaks who drink beer in the shower.  I also discovered this giant plastic egg filled with randomized collectibles (i.e. stuff that none of the other customers wanted).

Along with the rest of the brick-and-mortar retail sector, things have been rough for GameStop in the past several years. Just this summer, several employees were laid off from its Texas headquarters and GameStop owned-GameInformer. And its preorder system has been a mess. It seems like they’ll try any kind of gimmick to keep its retail stores afloat. They’ve sold customer data to third-party companies, minted a developer’s game as an NFT without his permission, and gave its retail staff a fifty-cent raise. Redditors complained about a surplus of inventory that customers weren’t buying and how they wished GameStop was still more of a video game store.',\n",

              "  'By  Elizabeth Lopatto / @mslopatto I was somewhat surprised that both Netflix and MSNBC chose to make documentaries about Wall Street Bets, GameStop, and retail traders. The majority of the action takes place online, after all. So what is the visual here? Watching someone type text into a box? As a result, MSNBC’s feature, Diamond Hands: The Legend of WallStreetBets, and Netflix’s series, Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga, rely heavily on stock footage. In the case of Diamond Hands, this has a ’90s MTV type of vibe; in the case of Eat the Rich, it seems like editors just slapped together whatever was handy and cheap. These shows appear to be less art and more “content” In both cases, these appear to be less art and more “content,” the kind of thing that’s cheap for streamers to commission. The story is gripping —\\xa0certainly I found it gripping while it was happening —\\xa0but the choice to make a documentary or a TV show about it is puzzling. At least Diamond Hands feinted at an aesthetic; Eat the Rich seems to be too openly contemptuous of its viewers to have considered more creative uses of stock. Both pieces of content felt rushed, trying to capitalize on attention while it was still there. Diamond Hands uses several Reddit forum members as its narrators so that viewers get to know and care about them. That makes it more compelling when, for instance, former military diver Matt Kelly recounts his sleepless nights and inability to focus on work as the stock started to fly. Alisha B. Woods, who describes herself as having an “addictive personality,” moves from GameStop into crypto, another realm of gambling. Despite its goofy aesthetic — it features Redditors pounding their chests; one is interviewed in a helmet — it’s tightly edited, and a pretty good history of the immediate events. Eat the Rich has larger ambitions, though it falls short of them. It opens by zooming back to the 2008 financial crisis — which is arguably the cause of this whole deal.

Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201.\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\tGameStop will likely surprise investors once again\\t\\t Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Editor’s note: This article was updated on Oct. 18 to correct free cash flow and stock split data. In July, GameStop (NYSE:GME) launched its NFT marketplace to a relatively muted reception. NFT trades had already fallen three-quarters since January, and traders assumed the game retailer had missed yet another party. Shares would eventually drop another 25%. Investor pessimism, however, has quietly turned GME stock into a short-squeeze candidate. Sagging trading volume means that it would take traders almost 17 days to cover their short positions, up from three days in July. And with 30% of GameStop shares now directly held by transfer agents, the Texas-based firm has become a trap for short sellers who didn’t get the memo the first time around.  In 2014, I shorted shares of watchmaker Movado (NYSE:MOV) as a bet on rival Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) newly launched smartwatch. Shares of Movado would slide from $45 to $25 before I closed the position at a significant profit. The emotional toll, however, was immense. Monitoring shares of the legacy firm was agonizing; every day brought new fears of unlimited losses. And had I stayed in the position, the volatile short sale would have cratered my client’s portfolio when shares jumped to $50 several years later. Unlike buying stocks, shorting them involves selling more when stocks go down and raises the risks of a wipeout. Movado would become my last negative bet, ever. Nevertheless, many institutional investors fail to remember the lessons of unhedged short-selling. Memories of meme stock blowups from early 2021 are fading. And falling markets are tempting short-sellers back into firms from Bed, Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) to electric charging station EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO). Nowhere is this clearer than at GameStop, a firm once short-squeezed by Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets to devastating effect. Since July, daily volatility of the video game retailer has declined by around half. On a per-day basis, GME stock now moves only as much as tech firms like',\n",

Eating the rich can now be done with a Netflix subscription — or reliving it, at least. Netflix released a series Wednesday called Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga about the online movement that drove up the stock price of the video game retailer and spooked Wall Street forever. Here\\'s what to know about the new series. According to the BBC, the retailer had been floundering during the pandemic, and its December 31, 2020 share price — before all of the controversy — was $4.71 a share. Hedge funds and other investors can sometimes bet against a company when it\\'s doing poorly in order to make money, and that is exactly what they were doing with GameStop. Amateur traders active on Reddit noticed that Wall Street was short-selling the stock, and they decided to flip the script. The millions of active users in the r/wallstreetbets channel were encouraged to buy shares to drive the price of the stock up in order to increase personal profit and \"squeeze the short positions of hedge funds,\" according to The Trade. Due to an online frenzy, massive coordination, influencers, and even Elon Musk tweeting \"Gamestonk!\", retail traders bought up tons of GameStop stock, which drove up the price. This meant that the people who bet on the stock going down — primarily larger, more traditional investors — lost a ton of money. Guy Warren, chief executive officer of FinTech ITRS Group, told The Trade that what happened \"[exposed] the vulnerability of the market as well as the weaknesses in firms\\' trading systems.\" \"Until now, retail trading activity has never been able to move the market one way or another...the power dynamic has shifted,\" he added. Robinhood limited trading on the stock on January 28, 2021, when GameStop\\'s price was about $80 a share. That\\'s a 1,598.51% increase from just a month before.

Both companies experienced massive short squeezes last January, but their stocks have declined sharply since hitting those frothy levels. GameStop's stock hit a split-adjusted all-time high of $86.88, but it now trades at about $25. Bed Bath & Beyond's stock rallied to a multi-year high of $52.89, but it's now only worth about $5 a share. Both stocks lost their luster as rising interest rates drove investors away from speculative meme stocks and other risky investments. But could either of these meme stocks stage a comeback and generate a five-bagger return in the near future? Image source: Getty Images. GameStop looks cheap at 1.2 times this year's sales, but Bed Bath & Beyond looks even cheaper at 0.07 times this year's sales. Some 17% of GameStop's outstanding shares were being shorted as of Sept. 29, compared to 38% of Bed Bath & Beyond's outstanding shares.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value remained above this threshold for the 14th consecutive day as investors continued to digest a range of issues that have been plaguing markets for weeks or longer. Bitcoin was recently trading at about $19,200, up ever so slightly from 24 hours earlier. Ether was recently changing hands just below the $1,300 level that has been its primary compass point for more than a month. Other major altcoins were largely flat, although XRP was up over 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.6%. Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $19,200, roughly where it stood Thursday, same time, and near the bottom of the $19,000 to $21,000 range BTC has held for more than a month. Trading volume remained moderate. Ether’s (ETH) was recently changing hands just below $1,300, also about the same from Thursday, and near its bottom support for much of the past month. Among the top altcoin gainers recently were XRP and EOS, which both climbed about 3%. Earlier in the day, Aptos’ APT token rose 4.5% to recover from its bumpy start a few days before. AXIE was off about 6%. Traditional financial markets ended the week on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 all gaining close to 2.5%.

              "  'The cryptocurrency market was mixed on Wednesday: While prices for top assets bitcoin and ether were unusually stable given their volatile history, tokens from decentralized finance (DeFi) took the spotlight. The CoinDesk Market Index fell by 0.8% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 0.8%, changing hands in a range between $19,000 and $19,500. Ether (ETH), the second-largest, followed a similar trajectory, down 0.4% to $1,300 as of press time. The trajectory was consistent with traditional markets on Wednesday, where the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.5% as investors processed a flurry of third-quarter earnings reports. “Even now there are plenty of bitcoin investors that look to overall market sentiment to guide them, so some of that negativity does end up getting mirrored,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partners. The crypto trading firm QCP Capital noted Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the options market “continues to unwind” trades that had been put on to protect against any swift price decline following last week’s U.S. Consumer Price Index release. The Labor Department’s report, published on Thursday, showed inflation running at a hotter-than-expected pace. Crypto and traditional markets, rather than taking a deep dive, as many analysts had expected, swerved higher. According to QCP, there aren’t many crucial economic data points to trade on until the Federal Reserve’s next meeting of its monetary-policy committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. “With little calendar events till the next FOMC in early November, crypto continuing to lag behind equities, and skews near flat, protective downside structures are the cheapest levels they have been since June,” QCP wrote. “Skew” refers to the relative balance in the options market between bearish and bullish trades. The outperformance of DeFi tokens on Wednesday was punctuated by gains from Uniswap, Aave and Maker.

Bitcoin made a surprise rally as equity markets continue to slide and amidst warnings that the pound could fall below dollar parity. The UK is experiencing slower growth and rising inflation caused by the government's borrowing throughout the coronavirus pandemic, supply chain disruptions with China and rising commodity prices due to the war in Ukraine. This inflationary environment was then exacerbated by the British chancellor of the exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng who signalled that he would commit to billions of pounds of extra borrowing. Last Friday, chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said he intends to scrap the UK's top income-tax rate of 45%, stop a scheduled rise in the national insurance rate, and abolish the stamp duty on property purchases of under £250,000 ($270,000).

Year to date, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has slumped a whopping 58%, losing more than $500 billion in market cap value with the majority of that decline occurring from April to July.

Following its major selling events through the second quarter, the largest digital coin and other cryptocurrencies has held up better than stocks and gold. Analysts aren't ready to say the trend indicates bitcoin's status as a risk-on asset that trades closest with stocks is meaningful—though they admit its higher correlation to gold could be an encouraging sign for investors seeking portfolio diversification. Gold, for its part, hasn't held up well under the past year's inflation either. From January to March, gold (GC=F) climbed 11% to a peak of $2,040 per ounce.
